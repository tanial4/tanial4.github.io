        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: justify;">Abstract— Due to external stimuli, biomedical signals are in general non-linear and non-stationary. <i>Empirical Mode Decomposition</i> in conjunction with a Hilbert spectral transform, together called <i>Hilbert-Huang Transform</i>, is ideally suited to extract essential components which are characteristic of the underlying biological or physiological processes. The method is fully adaptive and generates the basis to represent the data solely from these data and based on them. The basis functions, called <i>Intrinsic Mode Functions</i> (IMFs) represent a complete set of locally orthogonal basis functions whose amplitude and frequency may vary over time.

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">1. INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>Recently an empirical nonlinear analysis tool for complex, non-stationary time series has been pioneered by N. E. Huang et al. [1]. It is commonly referred to as <i>Empirical Mode Decomposition</i> (EMD) and if combined with Hilbert spectral analysis it is called <i>Hilbert - Huang Transform </i>(HHT). It adaptively and locally decomposes any non-stationary time series in a sum of <i>Intrinsic Mode Functions</i> (IMF) which represent zero-mean amplitude and frequency modulated components. The EMD represents a fully data-driven, unsupervised signal decomposition and does not need any a priori defined basis system. EMD also satisfies the perfect reconstruction property, i.e. superimposing all extracted IMFs together with the residual slow trend reconstructs the original signal without information loss or distortion. The method is thus similar to the traditional Fourier or wavelet decompositions but the interpretation of IMFs is not similarly transparent [2]. It is still a challenging task to identify and/or combine extracted IMFs in a proper way so as to yield physically meaningful components. Also, if only partial reconstruction is intended, it is not based on any optimality criterion rather on a binary <i>include</i> or <i>not include</i> decision.</p>
        <p>The empirical nature of EMD offers the advantage over other empirical signal decomposition techniques like <i>empirical matrix factorization</i> (EMF) of not being constrained by conditions which often only apply approximately. Especially with biomedical signals one often has only a rough idea about the underlying modes and mostly their number is unknown. This contribution will review the technique of empirical mode decomposition and its recent extensions.</p>

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">II. EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION</h5>
        <p>The EMD method was developed from the assumption that any non-stationary and non-linear time series consists of different simple intrinsic modes of oscillation. The essence of the method is to empirically identify these intrinsic oscillatory modes by their characteristic time scales in the data, and then decompose the data accordingly. Through a process called <i>sifting</i>, most of the <i>riding waves</i>, i.e. oscillations with no zero crossing between extrema, can be eliminated. The EMD algorithm thus considers signal oscillations at a very local level and separates the data into locally non-overlapping time scale components. It breaks down a signal x(t) into its component IMFs obeying two properties: 
        <ol>
            <li>An IMF has only one extremum between two subsequent zero crossings, i.e. the number of local minima and maxima differs at most by one.</li>
            <li>An IMF has a mean value of zero.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Note that the second condition implies that an IMF is stationary which simplifies its analysis. But an IMF may have amplitude modulation and also changing frequency.
            <ol>
                <li><i>Te EMD Algorithm:</i> The sifting process can be summarized in the following algorithm. Decompose a data set <em>x(t)</em> into IMFs <em>x<sub>n</sub>(t)</em> and a residuum <em>r(t)</em> such that the signal can be represented as:</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">x(t) = ∑ x<sub>n</sub>(t) + r(t) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sifting then means the following steps (see Fig. 1):
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 0:</strong> Initialize: <em>n := 1</em>, <em>r<sub>0</sub>(t) = x(t)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Extract the <em>n</em>-th IMF as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>Set <em>h<sub>0</sub>(t) := r<sub>n-1</sub>(t)</em> and <em>k := 1</em></li>
                <li>Identify all local maxima and minima of <em>h<sub>k-1</sub>(t)</em></li>
                <li>Construct, by cubic splines interpolation, for <em>h<sub>k-1</sub>(t)</em> the envelope <em>U<sub>k-1</sub>(t)</em> defined by the maxima and the envelope <em>L<sub>k-1</sub>(t)</em> defined by the minima</li>
                <li>Determine the mean <em>m<sub>k-1</sub>(t) = ½ (U<sub>k-1</sub>(t) - L<sub>k-1</sub>(t))</em> of both envelopes of <em>h<sub>k-1</sub>(t)</em>. This running mean is called the low-frequency local trend. The corresponding high-frequency local detail is determined via a process called <strong>sifting</strong>.</li>
                <li>Form the <em>k</em>-th component <em>h<sub>k</sub>(t) := h<sub>k-1</sub>(t) - m<sub>k-1</sub>(t)</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If <em>h<sub>k</sub>(t)</em> is not in accord with all IMF criteria, increase <em>k → k + 1</em> and repeat the Sifting process starting at step [b]</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
